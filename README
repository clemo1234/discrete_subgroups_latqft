Files:
convert.sh -- script for converting with kentucky2nersc
dym-mod-metro.cpp -- main file for simulating and computing observables
evermore.sh  -- script for running dym
group.c  -- file defines functions for group structures
kentucky2nersc -- compiled code that converts from kentucky format to nersc, only works for SU(3)
lattice.h  -- header for lattice.c
Makefile  -- Makefile for various components
timer.cpp -- used for timing algorithmic steps
data/    -- default folder for saving data   
dym-mod-metro-savecfg.cpp -- monte-carlo which outputs the configuration in matrix form, currently only works for SU(3)
group.h  -- file for defining group structures
groups   -- folder storing various groups
lattice.c  -- file that defines lattice and funtions on it
README    -- This file
timer.h    -- used for timing algorithmic steps
wilson_flow.c -- for computing the wilson flow, only naively works for SU(3)

To run basic montecarlo use: 
./evermore.sh {beta1} {beta2} {dimension} {Nt} {Nx} {group_file} {folder to output to WITH / at end}
